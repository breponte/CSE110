## Who am I? ##
### As a Person? ###

My name is **Brandon Reponte** and I am a second year Computer Science major at UCSD. I would say I am a person of simple taste that enjoys lowkey experiences. I am always exploring myself and searching for new passions. I do like watching anime/reading manga as I enjoy experiencing literature ~~One Piece~~. Other than that, I cannot really claim that I have any concrete hobbies (at least any creative ones), but I do like learning in general, such as through school, books, or videos. _I am always striving to be my best self in anything_.

### As a Programmer? ###

A common quote I hear in Computer Science is:
> "Start early, start often"

I am beginning to follow this better over the past several quarters, but sometimes I make one mistake and I feel behind again. However, I like to believe that I have good time management as I aim to build myself a time cushion to allow myself for error.

My general workflow is as follows:
1. Read writeup
2. Start coding
3. Finish

Obviously it is more complex than this. First I like to read my writeup and then outline a general plan I would like to take, researching potential tools and resources I might need. Then I would begin coding by splitting my code into modules and attempting to make a skeleton of the code. Lastly, I would try to test my code. This honestly sounds _pretty trash_ but I hope to improve my habits in years to come.

If you want to see one of the current courses I am taking, [here](https://github.com/breponte/CSE110) is the repository for the class ~~you should be looking at it right now~~. Peep the [README](README.md) as well if you would like. If you saw my [README](README.md) then you would have seen which my favorite programming language is. I will not tell you here so you will need to look at the [README](README.md), but I will give an ambiguous example as to one reason why I like it. Find the problem in this Python code.

```
    x = 42
    x = "meaning of life"
```

Now explain what should be stored in _x_? _x_ can store any type which gets confusing and requires comments. Pretty icky in my opinion. Moving on...

The provided repository includes:
- screenshots for Lab 1
- [.gitignore](.gitignore)
- [index.md](index.md) _you are reading_
- ~~PRIVATE.txt~~
- [README.md](README.md)

As of now, Lab 1 is almost complete:
- [X] Installing Visual Studio Code and Extensions
- [X] (Re)Familiarizing Ourselves with Git
- [ ] Using Markdown
